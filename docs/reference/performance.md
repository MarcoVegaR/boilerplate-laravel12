# Performance Best Practices

Guidelines for optimizing performance in our frontend and backend:

- Use partial reloads and lazy loading for heavy data.
- Cache where appropriate and avoid N+1 queries.
- Keep payloads small and avoid unnecessary props.
- Debounce/throttle expensive UI interactions.

TODO: Add detailed metrics, examples, and profiling workflows.
